{
Pullback attractors obtained for 6 models over the last 800~ka, forced by astronomical forcing with the parameters of the original publications. Shown is the model component representing ice volume or sea-level (the opposite of). Units are arbitrary in all models, except in T06 (ice volume in $10^{15}m^{3}$) and PP12 (opposite of sea-level, in m). All models show a single pullback attractor, although convergence was shown to be particularly slow in the Saltzman and Maasch models (in the sense illustrated on Figure \figref{fig:convergence}) and the solution  published by \cite{saltzman90sm}.
