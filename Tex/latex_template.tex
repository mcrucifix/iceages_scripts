\caption{(a) The stroboscopic section is obtained by superimposing the system state every forcing period ($P$), here illustrated for a 2:1 synchronisation. (b) The pullback section at time $t_0$ is obtained by superimposing the system states obtained by initialising the system with the ensemble of all possible initial conditions far back in time, here at $t_{\mathrm{back}}$. The particular example shows a global pullback attractor made of two local pullback attractors (in dashed red and blue), the sections of which are seen at $t$. Also shown is the convergence of initial conditions towards the pullback attractors, in grey. }
