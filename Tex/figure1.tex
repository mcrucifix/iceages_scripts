{
 Ice volume simulated with two models previously published: \cite{saltzman90sm}  and \cite{tziperman06pacing}, forced by normalised insolation at 65$^\circ$ N. The blue lines are obtained with the published parameters; the latter were slightly changed to obtain the red ones: $p_0=0.262$~Sv instead of $0.260$~Sv in \cite{tziperman06pacing}, and $w=0.6$ instead of $w=0.5$ in \cite{saltzman90sm}. While the qualitative aspect of the curves are preserved, the timing of ice ages is affected by the parameter changes.
