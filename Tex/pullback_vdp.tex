{
(top:) Pullback attractors of the forced van der Pol oscillator
 ($\beta=0.7$, $\alpha=30$, $\gamma=0.6$ with 2-period forcing) as on Figure \ref{fig:card_2periods}, 
 for $\tau=41$\,ka. They are reproduced on the graphs below (very thin lines), overlain by (middle:)  
 one pullback attractor with same parameters but $\tau=40\,\mathrm{ka}$, and
 (bottom:) one stochastic realisation of the stochastic van der pol oscillator with $\tau=41\ka$.
 % Observe that both stochastic and deterministic trajectories follow one or the other $\tau=40$ pullback attractors during a fraction of the time, but also spend a fraction of the time on a distinct path.
